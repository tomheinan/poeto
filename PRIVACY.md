Privacy Policy
==============

Last revised on 30 December 2023

### The Gist

The author of this app, Tom Heinan, will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites. He may use this data to better understand our users. He can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.

That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.

### Reuse

This document is based upon the [Automattic Privacy Policy](http://automattic.com/privacy/) and is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/). Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse Tom Heinan or its use of the work.

Tom Heinan ("Tom") makes available services include the app web site (http://poeto.app), the Poeto app, the associated keyboard extension, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Tom in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). It is Tom's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information he may collect while operating our websites.

### Questions

If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact Tom at me@tomheinan.com

### Visitors

Like most website operators, Tom collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and mobile operating systems typically make available, such as device type and the date and time of each user interaction. Tom's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tom's users use his software. From time to time, Tom may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of his app.

Tom also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Tom Heinan does not use such information to identify users, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that he uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain users to Tom's website and apps choose to interact with them in ways that require Tom to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Tom gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Tom collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user's interaction with Tom. Tom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Tom may collect statistics about the behavior of users of the app. For instance, Tom may monitor the most popular parts of the app. Tom Heinan may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Tom Heinan does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Tom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of his employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Tom's behalf or to provide services available at Tom's apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Tom will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to his employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Tom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Tom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tom, third parties or the public at large. Tom takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Data Storage
Tom uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.

### Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Tom may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Tom's sole discretion. Tom encourages users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
